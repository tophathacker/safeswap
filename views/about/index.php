    <h1>Welcome to My Idea</h1>
    <p>The idea behind <strong>Safe Swap</strong> started with electronics. I've been collecting
    junk my whole life. Useful junk, junk that has good parts I 'could' use some day. I hate to throw
    away anything that could be useful to someone, someday. I wanted to just ship it to the first 
    person that said they could use it. That being the case, I asked a few friends if they wanted any 
    of my junk. There were quite a few takers once I told them what was in my junk piles and I realized 
    that I don't really want to pay for shipping for all of that. In comes the idea. If I could some 
    how sort out all of the hassle of exchanging money for shipping something, I could help the exchange 
    of anything really. This web application isn't designed to make any money. In fact, I don't want any 
    money going through the site at all. Let's break this down a bit:</p>
    <p>Person A has stuff he wants to get rid of. He comes on this website and creates a post. He has 
    the option of uploading a picture and detailed description. He also can be very vague, but might not 
    get as many people interested. Person B is browsing the site and sees Person A's advertisement. 
    Person B fills out all the necessary information for the transaction and gets forwarded to a shipping 
    website to finish the transaction. He buys a shipping label directly from UPS/USPS/Fedex and that 
    shipping label comes back to the site, and get's forwarded on to Person A.</p>
    <p>At this point, Person B hasn't been charged yet. In fact, if Person A doesn't ship the package with 
    the preaddressed shipping label, Person B won't ever get charged. Person B is only charged when that 
    tracking number goes live. Also, Person B doesn't have to worry that Person A will use his shipping 
    label to ship something to Person C, he can only ship to Person B's address. </p>
    <p>Hopefully with this low risk model, the exchange of low dollar items can happen more freely amongst 
    those of us with like minds :)</p>
