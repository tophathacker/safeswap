SafeSwap
========

The SafeSwap web application is based around the simple idea that if Person A has stuff, they can post it on the site. If Person B wants that stuff, they fill out their address and purchase a shipping label. Person A will get that shipping label, pre-paid with Person B's address and will ship their stuff from A to B.

Abuse?
========

There is little chance for abuse with this system and here's why:
Money doesn't change hands. The receiver of 'stuff' pays for the shipping label directly and doesn't have to worry about the sender keeping the money and running. The sender can't use the shipping label to send stuff to a third party, it's already addressed to the receiver. The sender has two options after they get a shipping label, they can either ship the box or not. If they don't ship the box the receiver never gets charged, they only get charged when the tracking number goes live and the box actually get's shipped. The worst case scenario here is that the receiver might not get what they expected, but then again isn't that the fun?

Changes
========
I've converted over to an MVC architecture, the first I've attempted. That being said, if there's any way I can improve upon my methodology, please let me know.

Future
========
I'd like to make bootstrap a git submodule, but i'll deal with that later when I start to add templating.
